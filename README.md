<center>Moti Ben-Ari</center>

This repository bundles all the documents and program written by myself (and others) for the [Thymio robot](https://www.thymio.org/). The directories are:

- `aseba-projects`: A set of projects in the Aseba language. A document guiding the development of the projects is included as well as solutions.

- `elements-of-robotics`: Implementations of the activities in [_Elements of Robotics_](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-62533-1) (co-author: Francesco Mondada of EPFL) both in Aseba and Python. The electronic book can be downloaded for free.

- `python-tutorial`: A tutorial on programming the Thymio with Python.

- `scratch`: Simulations in Scratch of Thymio algorithms. You can directly access these projects on the Scratch website at [http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/1023692](http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/1023692).

- `vpl-tutorial`: A tutorial on programming the Thymio with VPL.
